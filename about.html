<h3> Experience </h3>
<br />
<h4> June 2012-present Software Developer at A4 Solutions </h4>
Managed a council and charity website by updating it with the necessary documents. Worked on developing a Swift Application with the use of CocoaPods and worked on a MVC application. Currently using hugo to develop a website. 
<br />
<br />
<h4> Eli Lilly Hackathon 2016</h4>
I participated in a 24 hour hackathon at the university, to create a mobile app using the Salesforce platform. We worked in a group of 4. It required quick learning skills and familiarity with the Salesforce platform. 
<br />

<br />
<h4> December 2015 Student Ambassador </h4>
Answering questions from prospective year 13 students about the Computer Science course and the university in a relaxed environment. Required good interpersonal skills. Displayed a small project made in People and Computing during Open Days to help promote the university.
<br />
<br />
<h4> October 2014 Designing a LiteHUD prototype stand for BAE Systems (Engineering Education Scheme) </h4>
This involved working in a small group to develop ideas and make a moving prototype stand, as the current problem was that people had to crouch down to view the HUD at the air show. This was done at the same time as my A Levels, so good time management skills and leadership skills were needed. 
<br />
<br />
<h4>June 2014 Work Experience at ERRIN in Brussels</h4>
Allocated tasks by a company called ERRIN in Brussels for 3 weeks. These involved from making leaflets, to analysing their website. Attended meetings on financial instruments and a variety of other topics.
<br />
<br />
Other experience includes running a Code Club at a Primary School, and teaching the students how to think logically and to use Scratch.
